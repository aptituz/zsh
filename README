This contains some zsh functions I find useful. To use them, either:

1) Create a directory ~/.zsh/functions and put the files you need in there
2) Put something like this into your zshrc

if [ -e $HOME/.zsh/functions ]; then
    autoload $HOME/.zsh/functions/*(:t)
fi

or copy the content of the files to your zshrc.
